                    The Space Shuttle program was the fourth human spaceflight program carried out by the National
                    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished routine transportation for
                    Earth-to-orbit crew and cargo from 1981 to 2011. Its official name, Space Transportation System
                    (STS), was taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item
                    funded for development.
